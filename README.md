# Dynamic-Memory-Allocator
Simulation implementing both buddy and slab memory management schemes. The actual implementation of these algorithms can be found in my_memory.c, where we have
implemented functions for both allocating (malloc) and deallocating (free) memory based on the requested input test file.
